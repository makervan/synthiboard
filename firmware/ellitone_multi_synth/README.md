# Ellitone Multi-Synth

An adapted version of the Ellitone Multi-Synth, to work on the Synthiboard.

The Multi-Synth uses the Mozzi library, which uses a different output pin than the default of the Synthiboard.

TODO: Add drawing of wiring hacks on the Synthiboard to make this work.

* This does not include the wavetable header files, which have to be taken from the GDrive folder (see below). You can place them directly in the ``tables`` subdirectory, no need to put them into the Mozzi library folders as described in the original comments in the source.
